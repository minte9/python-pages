### Exercises / List Comprehension

1. Capitalize each letter from a string and put them in a list.  
   Use a single line of code using list comprehension.  
      S = "Hippopotamus"  

2. Capitalize each letter from a string and put them in a set.  
   Use a single line of code using set comprehension.  
      S = "Hippopotamus"  

3. Use dictionary comprehension to cut in half the items' prices  
      P = {'milk': 1.02, 'coffe': 2.20}

4. Create a function that transform a matrix (list) into a tree (of nodes).  
   Use a Node class (with a value and children list as attributes).  
   Loop recursively through the matrix using a for loop.  
   Do the same using list comprehension.  
   ` 
      M = [  
        [3, 4],  
        [8, [-2, 10], 5],  
        7,  
      ]  
      tree = matrix_to_tree(M)  
   `
