### Exercises / Conditional expression

1. Use conditional expression to assign a new variable.  
   If variable a is greater than 100 assign b to 10, else assign to -1.   
   a = 0  

2. Define the function to get the factorial of a number.   
   Use conditional expression. 
   ``` 
   Factorial of 0! = 1  
   Factorial of n! = n(n-1)! 

   factorial(0) == 1  
   factorial(1) == 1  
   factorial(2) == 2  
   factorial(3) == 6  
   ```
